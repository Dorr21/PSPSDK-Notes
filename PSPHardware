< The SoC >
Most people think of a computer's CPU, RAM, and GPU as being their own separate parts due to many only seeing the internals of a traditional PC. However, this
approach takes up a lot of space and uses lots of energy, which isn't something you want for a portable device. This is why almost all small devices, the PSP
included, take the circuits for all of these components and combine them into one small chip called a 'System On a Chip', or SoC for short. While SoC-based
computers aren't as powerful as discrete-part computers, they are far smaller, produce less heat, and use less energy.

The PSP's SoC is named Tachyon,
